## Motivation behind creating this

***Many students, including me, have to login to each job portal and search with the lots of filters to get our desired job opening. It's so time consuming for us which ultimately lessens the time to focus on our studies.  
I saw this to be a challenge and thought of the solution for it. & I've got my solution in 'Automation'.
I'm spending lots of my time to get this project to be completed. It'll help some job seakers to use it to search for their dream job.***

## Why to use it?

- You don't need to open the portals to check for the desired openings.
- Just need some inputs from the user for customizing their search results.
- This script automatically searches for the job openings without you interfering in the middle of execution. So, you can perform any high-priority work in between.
- The file it saves about the job opening details is updated every second, so filename duplicacy will never happen.
- You don't need to go through each opening & search for their desired qualifications, experience etc.
- Easily customizable to some extent with the filter and keywords to search in the portals
